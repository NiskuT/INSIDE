## THE  PITCH
*Quantum computers* are quite a complicated subject to study and it is often challenging to get an idea of ​​how such a system works. We would like to help instruct people about such technologies by providing them with an additional **visualization tool**.

## THE PROPOSAL OVERVIEW

We hope with this project to assist educating people in the field of *superconducting quantum computer*. We want to develop a plugin for *qiskit pulse* allowing to visualize the execution of a quantum circuit inside a quantum computer. The plugin will generate animations describing the evolution of the different rf signals in a **virtual model in 3d** of a quantum computer.

|Make a modular 3d model of a quantum computer. This modular 3d model will be able to produce visuals approaching the different computers of the IBM Q Network.|Find a way to link Qiskit Pulse with our 3D engine (Unity 3D or other).|Make a simulation framework for the rf signals based on Qiskit Pulse and [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06560.pdf) and display the simulations results in relation to what as been feed to Qiskit Pulse.|Constitute a repository for the plugin as well as some documentation.|
